# Assets Usage Tracking

This project is a sample application that demonstrates how to use the Adobe Experience Platform SDK to track assets in a web application. The application is built using the Adobe I/O App Builder and uses the Adobe I/O Runtime to host the application and the Adobe Experience Platform SDK to track assets.

## Local Run

- Run `aio app run` to start the application
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:9080` to see the app running locally and it will redirect to assets usage report page.
- pass `hlxUrl` query parameter to see the assets usage report for the given hlxUrl for example 
  -> https://localhost:9080/assetsUsageReport.html?hlxUrl=https://demo-custom-as-config--franklin-assets-selector--hlxsites.hlx.live/
- To view your deployed application in the Experience Cloud shell:
